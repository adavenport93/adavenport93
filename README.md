## Hi: All about me!
Since I was a child, I had a fascination with technology. I love the idea that you can take software and manipulate/develop it into something unique. I was that child who questioned everything my parents told me but with a purpose. I didnâ€™t do it to rebel but to challenge in order to change my perception and of those around me. Please donâ€™t get me wrong; I follow directions but I often inspire new ideas by thinking differently. I donâ€™t like to stick to the notion that this is the way something has always been done and should be done. I think more like how can I make this process better. 

I currently have a bachelorâ€™s and masterâ€™s in information technology.
I am currently employed as an Engineer at Savannah River Site in South Carolina.
Now I plan on graduating from Arizona State University with an engineering science degree.
