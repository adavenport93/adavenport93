## Hi: All about me!
Since I was a child, I had a fascination with technology. I love the idea that you can take software and manipulate/develop it into something unique. I was that child who questioned everything my parents told me but with a purpose. I didn’t do it to rebel but to challenge in order to change my perception and of those around me. Please don’t get me wrong; I follow directions but I often inspire new ideas by thinking differently. I don’t like to stick to the notion that this is the way something has always been done and should be done. I think more like how can I make this process better. 

I currently have a bachelor’s and master’s in information technology.
I am currently employed as an Engineer at Savannah River Site in South Carolina.
Now I plan on graduating from Arizona State University with an engineering science degree.

My previous work experience includes:
- Service Support Rep 2 at Unisys
- Client Support Specialist at Augusta University IT Help Desk
- Legal Secretary at the Division of Child Support Services

My computer skills include:
- Languages: C#, HTML5, CSS3, Java, C++, JavaScript, and Python   
- Operating Systems: Windows, Linux, and Mac OS          
- Databases: Microsoft Access and SQL                     
- Software: Microsoft Excel, Microsoft PowerPoint, Microsoft Publisher, Microsoft Visual Studio, and Microsoft Word, Visio, and VMWare Workstation
